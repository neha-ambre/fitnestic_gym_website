      <h2 class="featurette-heading">The Paleo Diet </h2>
      <p class="lead" style="font-size: medium;">A Paleo diet is a dietary plan which consists of foods similar to what might have been consumed
        during the Paleolithic era, approximately 2.5 million to 10,000 years ago.
        This typically includes lean meats, fish, fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds — foods that could be obtained by
        hunting and gathering in the past.
        It’s health benefits may include:
        Weight loss, due to a lower carbohydrate and sugar intake on the diet.
        Increased insulin sensitivity.
        Improved heart health.
        Increased and sustained energy.
        Less inflammation.
        There are great Paleo diet meal options through Sun Basket such as Thai Turkey Lettuce Cups and Green Goddess
        Steak Salad with Roasted Carrots.</p>

      <h2 class="featurette-heading">Intermittent Fasting</h2>
      <p class="lead" style="font-size: medium;">There are different approaches to intermittent fasting, with the most popular being an 8:16
      split — meaning you consume your calories in an eight-hour eating window and fast for the other 16 hours of the
      day. You can also do a 10:16, 16:10, or even 6:20 eating:fasting split. Some extremists go as far as squeezing a
      whole day’s worth of calories into a single hour.

      The concept is that you’ll be eating fewer calories since you’re squeezing them into a narrower timeframe, as
      opposed to consuming them throughout the day.

      During the fasting period, you’re allowed zero-calorie beverages such as black coffee, herbal teas, and sparkling
      and flat water.

      Several studies have found that IF not only results in weight loss but can help improve insulin resistance, reduce
      oxidative stress on your cells, stabilize blood sugar levels, and reduce the risk of strokes.

      <h2 class="featurette-heading">Mediterranean Diet</h2>
      <p class="lead" style="font-size: medium;">As the name suggests, the Mediterranean Diet is inspired by the eating habits of people who live
        near the Mediterranean Sea. Those countries include Greece, Italy, Spain, Lebanon, Turkey, and more. These
        countries have some of the longest life expectancies in the world. According to a study in the Lancet Medical
        Journal, Spain’s citizens are expected to live to an average age of 85.8 years. (5) The United States’ life
        expectancy, for comparison, is about 78.5 years.

        The diet is rich in heart-healthy foods such as vegetables, fish, fruit, grains, olive oil, and nuts.
        Consumption of red meat is kept to a minimum, and dairy intake is moderate and consists of high-quality sources
        such as yogurt and cheeses.

      <h2 class="featurette-heading">Ketogenic Diet</span></h2>
      <p class="lead" style="font-size: medium;">Keto, as it’s called for short, is a diet that prioritizes fat (65-75 percent of your daily
        calories), with moderate protein consumption (20-30 percent) and very few carbs (only about five percent, though
        some versions prohibit carbs altogether). Which means you’ll be eating a lot of avocados, eggs, and bunless
        cheeseburgers.
        The Keto diet was designed to keep the body in a near-constant state of ketosis, a metabolic state where the
        body creates ketones from fat to use as energy instead of sugar from carbs (the body’s primary and preferred
        energy source). There have also been claims it may help treat cancer and even respiratory illnesses. (8) As
        mentioned above, weight loss comes down to calories in vs. calories out. Several studies point out keto is no
        more effective for weight loss when calories are matched with other diets.
